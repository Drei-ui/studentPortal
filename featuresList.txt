Search and Filter
Simple search functionality and basic filter options (name, ID, email) are straightforward with basic query logic and UI updates.

Student Profile Page
Creating a basic profile page involves rendering existing student data with potential for more detailed views. Adding an upload feature for profile pictures can be done using file handling and storage.

Role-Based Access Control
Implementing role-based access involves managing permissions for admins, teachers, and students, which is manageable with user roles and permissions logic.

Student Grades Management
Viewing grades is easy, but adding grades requires creating forms, database updates, and data validation, making it a bit more complex.

Attendance Tracking
Marking and viewing attendance involves user interaction with forms and data tables, which is somewhat more involved but still manageable with good UI and database integration.

Calendar and Scheduling
Displaying important events and schedules using a calendar requires a good UI component, and possibly integration with external calendar libraries.

Notifications
Real-time notifications and email/SMS alerts require backend event triggers and integration with third-party APIs (email, SMS services).

Assignment Submission
Adding file upload functionality for assignment submission involves more complex file handling and storage management, plus teacher feedback features.

Message Center
Creating a messaging system requires real-time communication handling, message storage, and UI for easy user interaction.

Reports and Analytics
Performance reports and dashboard analytics require aggregation of student data, visual representation, and exporting capabilities.

Student Progress Tracking
Progress bars and goals tracking would need real-time data updates, detailed student performance tracking logic, and visual elements.

File Sharing and Resources
Uploading and sharing course materials involves file management, user access control, and potentially large file handling.

Dark Mode/Light Mode
Implementing theme toggles requires UI enhancements, CSS modifications, and persistence of user preferences across sessions.

User Activity Logs
Tracking user actions requires backend logging for actions like login, profile updates, and file submissions, plus a UI for viewing logs.

Student Performance Comparison
Comparing student performance with averages requires additional data processing and visualization to provide insights.

Integration with External Services
Integrating services like Google Classroom or payment systems involves third-party API handling, user authentication, and data syncing.

Multi-Language Support
Adding support for multiple languages involves internationalization (i18n), translations, and managing various text formats across the portal. It becomes increasingly complex depending on the number of languages supported.
